                <p>
                    Serve God, love me and mend <br> 
                    This is not the end <br>
                    Live unbruised, we are friends <br>
                    And I'm sorry, I'm sorry <br>
                </p>
                
                <p> 
                    no more, no more <br>
                    One foot in sea, one on shore <br>
                    My heart was never pure <br>
                    You know me, you know me <br>
                </p>

                <P>
                    But man is a giddy thing <br>
                    Oh, man is a giddy thing <br>
                    Oh, man is a giddy thing <br>
                    Oh, man is a giddy thing <br>
                </P>

                <p>
                    Love, it will not betray you <br>
                    Dismay or enslave you, it will set you free <br>
                    Be more like the man you were made to be <br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    There is a design, an alignment <br>
                    A cry of my heart to see <br>
                    The beauty of love as it was made to be <br>
                </p>
