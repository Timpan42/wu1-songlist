                <p>
                    Serve God, love me and mend <br> 
                    This is not the end <br>
                    Live unbruised, we are friends <br>
                    And I'm sorry, I'm sorry <br>
                </p>
                
                <p> 
                    no more, no more <br>
                    One foot in sea, one on shore <br>
                    My heart was never pure <br>
                    You know me, you know me <br>
                </p>

                <P>
                    But man is a giddy thing <br>
                    Oh, man is a giddy thing <br>
                    Oh, man is a giddy thing <br>
                    Oh, man is a giddy thing <br>
                </P>

                <p>
                    Love, it will not betray you <br>
                    Dismay or enslave you, it will set you free <br>
                    Be more like the man you were made to be <br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    There is a design, an alignment <br>
                    A cry of my heart to see <br>
                    The beauty of love as it was made to be <br>
                </p>

                <h3>The Cave</h3>
                <p>
                    It's empty in the valley of your heart<br>
                    The sun, it rises slowly as you walk<br>
                    Away from all the fears<br>
                    And all the faults you've left behind<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The harvest left no food for you to eat<br>
                    You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see<br>
                    But I have seen the same<br>
                    I know the shame in your defeat<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    But I will hold on hope<br>
                    And I won't let you choke<br>
                    On the noose around your neck<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    And I'll find strength in pain<br>
                    And I will change my ways<br>
                    I'll know my name as it's called again<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    ‘Cause I have other things to fill my time<br>
                    You take what is yours and I'll take mine<br>
                    Now let me at the truth<br>
                    Which will refresh my broken mind<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    So tie me to a post and block my ears<br>
                    I can see widows and orphans through my tears<br>
                    I know my call despite my faults<br>
                    And despite my growing fears<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    But I will hold on hope<br>
                    And I won't let you choke<br>
                    On the noose around your neck<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    And I'll find strength in pain<br>
                    And I will change my ways<br>
                    I'll know my name as it's called again<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    So come out of your cave walking on your hands<br>
                    And see the world hanging upside down<br>
                    You can understand dependence<br>
                    When you know the maker's land<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    So make your siren's call<br>
                    And sing all you want<br>
                    I will not hear what you have to say<br>
                </p>


                <p>
                    ‘Cause I need freedom now<br>
                    And I need to know how<br>
                    To live my life as it's meant to be<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    And I will hold on hope<br>
                    And I won't let you choke<br>
                    On the noose around your neck<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    And I'll find strength in pain<br>
                    And I will change my ways<br>
                    I'll know my name as it's called<br> 
                </p>
